        <p>I started coding from bat script in middle school this gave me an overwhelming feeling of possibilities that programming provides. I chose IT specialist as next step of education, all the time I was coding from tutorials, making databases with SQL, forms in JS, CSS, and I really liked PHP. Later on, I wanted a quadcopter but it was to simple to just buy it... I sold portfolio to some Dj and bought Arduino and programmed it using C. Nowadays I learn mostly Python and React. I am interested in IoT. And would appreciate if someone would show me where to go </p>
