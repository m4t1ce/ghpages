        <p>I started coding from bat script at middle school this gave me an
          overwhelming feeling of possibilities that programming gives. 
          I chosed IT specialist as next step in education, all time I was coding from tutorials, 
          making databases with SQL, forms in JS,CSS, and I really liked PHP. 
          Later on I wanted a quadcopter but it was to simple to just buy it...
          I selled portfolio to some dj
          and bought arduino and programmed it using C.
          Nowdays I learn mostly Python and React. I am really interested in IOT. 
          And would appreciate if someone would show me where to go </p>
      </div>)
